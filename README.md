# ITAI 2372 Final Project: Anomaly Detection in Spacecraft Telemetry
## Authors 
Jazmine Brown and Troy Nsofar
## Project Track 
Conceptual Design Track 
## Background
This section provides context on spacecraft telemetry and the importance of anomaly detection. 
## Project Description
This project proposes an AI based system for detecting anomalies in spacecraft telemetry data, such as temperature, pressure, and voltage readings. The solution aims to identify irregularities that could indicate potential system failures, imporving mission safety and efficiency for NASA operations. The repository contains a detailed project proposal, solution plan, testing plan, and presentation slides outlining the conceptual design.
